Droughts have complex and multifaceted consequences that spread over vast spatial areas. Current physical indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index, predominantly focus on droughts' meteorological and hydrological aspects while overlooking the impacts. In this context, social media offers a unique perspective where users can share their firsthand experiences of droughts, providing valuable insights missed by traditional methods. This study aims to 1) analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of social media users' perceived impacts of droughts and 2) compare these with the Standardized Precipitation Index and severity scores from the news report-based European Drought Impact Database to explore the alignment and discrepancies between perceived impacts and actual water deficits and their severity. We focused on the drought occurred in Italy in 2022, which drew attention from various sectors and communities. We selected relevant tweets that addressed droughts in Italy and assessed the gravity of perceived impacts in each sector based on their semantic clusters. Our findings suggest that social media can enhance drought monitoring by capturing immediate public reactions, particularly for visible impacts during peak summer months.
